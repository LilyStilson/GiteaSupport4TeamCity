I am interested in the "*Gitea support for TeamCity*" project for several reasons. Firstly, my university has adopted Gitea as its internal DevOps platform for both students and teachers, and this project presents an excellent opportunity for me to align my academic experience with real-world applications. I believe that bridging the gap between Gitea and TeamCity can significantly enhance our development processes, and I'm eager to contribute to this endeavor.

Moreover, this project provides a valuable learning experience for me. As someone who has not previously worked with CI/CD systems like TeamCity, I am eager to delve into the intricacies of how they function and understand their impact on software development. Additionally, the prospect of gaining hands-on experience with the Kotlin programming language, which is used in TeamCity, is highly appealing.

In sum, my passion for this project is rooted in its potential to enhance my academic and practical knowledge while offering a chance to work with a powerful combination of tools and technologies.
